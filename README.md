## MindMap-bakcup
Some notes from my undergraduate days, for assisting classmates in preparing for final exams during the pandemic. 
You might be surprised by the amount of effort I committed.

The expanded graph's layout is too intricate to be exported to a PDF file. 
Therefore, I have shared the original file with the ".xmind" suffix for the optimal experience. 
You may use [xmind](https://xmind.app) to access these files.
